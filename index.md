# The Best Foods for a Low Sodium and Low Oxalate Diet

## Mission Statement
This webpage is here to provide a guiding hand to those who want to know more about a low oxalate and low sodium diet to help prevent calcium oxalate kidney stones. These opinions are based on factual studies but I am by no means a professional on the matter. Not only do I know from experience, it still affects my life, and I am constantly trying to find the best information on them.


## Typical Do's and Don'ts

Do find flavors and foods that inspire you
Don't rely on salt, in fact cut it out as much as possible

Do eat mostly vegetables and grains
Don't fill up on meat first 

Do use fresh herbs like basil, dill, lemonbalm, peppermint, sage, and other fresh flavors like garlic, onion, ginger, and citrus juice.
Don't use cinnnamon, nutmeg, tumeric, curry spices, chocololate, pepper, garlic powder, onion powder, ginger powder, allspice, 

Do use store bought regular pasta as most of it is salt free and low in oxalate because of it use of all purpose flour. I suggest making a an olive oil and garlic sauce topped with parm or a cheese of your choosing.
Don't use whole grain or gluten free(as long as you don't have celiac disease) as it contains more oxalate. I would however avoid tomato sauce as well as tomatoes and reduced tomatoes contain a fair amount of oxalic content.

Do eat fresh, homemade meals
Don't eat processed food

Do use vinegar based hot sauce in low moderation
Don't use too much heat as it will overwork your kidneys. Hot sauces other than vinegar contain more salt and should be avoided.

## Greens
After a clear struggle and large debate over which green vegetables are safe for those at risk of kidney stone, it has been decided that the brassica family is the best overall. It include cabbages, broccoli, cauliflower bok choy, and more. Broccoli and cauliflower can be served a variety of ways but the least known is lightly searing them in a pan with no oil at medium-high heat.

## Other Nutritional Veggies
We will start with the riddle: what type of room can't you enter? Mushrooms! Yes, wild mushrooms pack a great nutritional punch. If you can't find them at your local store, feel free to use cremeni, portobello, shitake,... it's all good! You can fry them, bake them, stuff them, and even ferment them!

## Grains
"They" say no whole grain for all grains. In short, hulled grains have less oxalate and overall white rice is best. But let's say you want to put some barley in a soup, you can find hulled barley and use it sparingly.

## Nuts, Seeds, and Legumes
We will start with nuts. Nuts are an unfortunate food that must be given up on a daily basis. There is still room for them as a treat once and a while but for the 

## Meat
Meat should be eaten in moderation anyways, but it is particularly so for those with kidney stone and other kidney related issues. In general, more vegetables need to become a part of our diet. That being said, chicken and fish are best but it is recommended that beef is encorperated into your diet about once per week. Pork is the least healthy, providing less nutritional value and more unhealthy fats. It is to be noted that while most seafood provide healthy sources of protein, they can retain more sodium than you would expect even if they are fresh. So remember that and don't hesitate to google the oxalate content of anything. Another important fact is that anything canned will have sodium, so be mindful.

## Spice and Sauce
Mushroom Toona Sauce 90mg sodium/tsp
Sriracha in moderation

### Things to Watch Out for with Sodium
-Juicing: Juicing veg concentrates the nutrients as well as the sodium and oxalate content. Make sure there is no celery, kale, or, God forbid, spinach ever in your healthy juice.
-Prescriptions: not very often, but sometimes, sodium will be used as a binding agent to whatever drug they are administering.

### Homemade sauces and ideas
-For a stir-fry you can mix chinese black vinegar, a little sriracha, mushroom toona sauce, a drop of sesame oil, a dollop of grapeseed/canola/veg oil
